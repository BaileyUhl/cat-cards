# Cat Cards (API Cat Facts and Cat Photos)

Responsive website that utilizes APIs to retrieve random cat pictures and cat facts. The website includes a description of the website, testimonials, a place to view/ generate/ and add a caption cat cards, and a location where you can see all of your saved cat cards. Cat Cards was created using HTML, CSS, APIs, Java, and JavaScript.

Github doesn't support dynamic websites, so the API features aren't functional, but you can view the code for that above.
